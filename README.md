# 👋 Hi, I’m Matti Seise (@mattiseise)

I’m a vocational special education teacher (ICT) based in Helsinki, working at the intersection of accessibility, learning support, and practical AI use in education and office work.

## 🧠 What I do
- Teach upper secondary vocational ICT: web technologies, Python, JavaScript, cybersecurity, and IT support
- Build practical automation to remove everyday friction (Python + Selenium, small browser tools)
- Train and consult on generative AI use for teaching and modern knowledge work
- Design support structures and tools that help students with diverse learning needs succeed

## 🔧 Currently focused on
- GenAI tools and lightweight “agent-like” workflows for teaching and office productivity
- Process automation with Python/Selenium and browser extensions
- Responsible, critical use of AI to support learning and accessibility

## 🧩 Things I’ve built / explored
- GPT-based assistants for breaking down learning tasks, planning demonstrations, and improving accessibility
- Tools for progress tracking and updating student completion data in school systems
- Browser helpers for highlighting missing work / surfacing submissions more clearly

## 🎮 Outside of work
I’m into story-driven RPGs and Teamfight Tactics, train regularly (BodyCombat & BodyPump), and do drone photography (DJI Mini 4 Pro).
